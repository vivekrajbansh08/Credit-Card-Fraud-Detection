# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
About :
The Credit Card Fraud Detection Problem includes modeling past credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turned out to be fraud. So, this system is used to identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not. Our aim here is to detect 100% of the fraudulent transactions while minimizing the incorrect fraud classifications. The objective of the project is to perform data visualization techniques to understand the insight of the data. Machine learning is often required to get an understanding of the data and its insights. This project aims to apply various Python tools to get a visual understanding of the data and clean it to make it ready to apply machine learning operations to it.
